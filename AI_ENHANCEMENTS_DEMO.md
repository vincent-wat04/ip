## 🚀 New AI-Powered Features

### 1. 🧠 Smart Input Validation & Suggestions
- **Typo correction**: Automatically suggests corrections for misspelled commands
- **Format validation**: Provides helpful error messages with examples
- **Contextual suggestions**: Offers relevant suggestions based on current state

**Examples:**

```

### 2. 🗣️ Natural Language Date/Time Parsing
Enhanced date parsing that understands human language:

**Supported formats:**

- Specific days: `next monday`, `this friday`
- Time periods: `in 3 days`, `in 2 weeks`
- Natural times: `3pm`, `2:30am`, `1400`

**Examples:**
```
deadline Submit report /by tomorrow 5pm
event Team meeting /from today 2pm /to today 3pm

```

### 3. 🎯 AI-Powered Task Priority System
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically suggests priority based on task content
- **Smart categorization**: Analyzes keywords to determine urgency

- **MEDIUM**: soon, report, project, assignment, call, email, review
- **LOW**: someday, maybe, consider, leisure, hobby

**Examples:**
```
Input: "todo urgent meeting preparation"
